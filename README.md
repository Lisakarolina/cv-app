# CV-App

The [CV Application](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-cv-application) is one of the projects in the Javascript Module of The Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript Path. The task was to create a react app that allows the user two fill in a form with the pieces of information that are expected to be present in a cv of an application. When pushing the submit button the data is mirrored on the right side of the page, arranged and set out like it would be on a page.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
